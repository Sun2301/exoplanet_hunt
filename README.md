## The Challenge: Hunting for Exoplanets

The NASA Space Apps Challenge 2025 presented us with the task of developing AI tools to aid in the discovery of exoplanets. The primary challenge lies in analyzing vast amounts of stellar data to identify potential exoplanets among thousands of candidates.

### Available Detection Methods

1. **Transit Method** (Our Focus)
   - Detects planets by measuring periodic dimming of starlight
   - Provides data on planet size and orbital period
   - Primary method used by Kepler mission
   - Challenges: False positives from binary stars, stellar variations

2. **Radial Velocity Method**
   - Measures star's wobble due to planetary gravitational pull
   - Provides data on planet mass
   - Complementary to transit method
   - Limitations: Requires high-precision spectroscopy

3. **Direct Imaging**
   - Attempts to visually observe planets
   - Best for young, bright planets far from their stars
   - Limited by current technology

### Our Approach: Machine Learning with KOI Data

We chose to focus on analyzing the Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) data for several reasons:

1. **Preprocessed Data**: KOI data provides already processed transit parameters, making it more accessible for educational purposes
2. **Rich Feature Set**: Each KOI entry includes key orbital parameters and transit characteristics
3. **Educational Value**: Working with KOI data helps understand the key parameters that identify exoplanets
4. **AI Potential**: Machine learning can effectively classify KOI candidates using their orbital parameters

### Why Random Forest Classification?

Our solution employs a Random Forest Classifier because:

1. **Interpretability**: Unlike "black box" deep learning models, Random Forests provide clear feature importance rankings
2. **Robustness**: Handles both numerical and categorical data well, resistant to outliers
3. **Performance**: Achieves 90% accuracy without requiring extensive computational resources
4. **Educational Merit**: Helps users understand which planetary parameters are most significant

## Technical Implementation

### Data
- **Source**: NASA Kepler Cumulative KOI (Kepler Objects of Interest) Table
- **Features**: 11 orbital parameters including period, transit depth, duration, planetary radius, and equilibrium temperature
- **Split**: 80% training, 20% testing
- **Preprocessing**: StandardScaler normalization, missing value handling

### Model
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier (scikit-learn)
- **Performance**: 90% accuracy on test set
- **Training**: Supervised learning on labeled historical KOI data
- **Output**: Binary classification (exoplanet candidate vs. false positive) with confidence score

### Interface
- **Framework**: Streamlit
- **Design**: Web-based, no installation required for end users
- **Focus**: Educational experience with pre-loaded examples
